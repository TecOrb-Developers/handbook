**Please describe your experience with Unit Testing and TDD**


I worked with unit testing and TDD for approximately 10+ Projects some of them are Online Food delivery, On-demand taxi booking, Medicare, E-commerce, OTT, etc.

**Unit Testing with RSpec:**
RSpec is my preferred testing framework for unit testing in Ruby on Rails because  It provides a clean and expressive syntax for writing tests, making it easy to create test cases for models, controllers, jobs, and other components of a Rails application.
- For Models: I have written numerous unit tests for models to validate the business logic, validations, associations, and custom methods.
- For controllers: I have written RSpec test cases to test actions, route mappings, and responses. These tests ensure that the controllers handle incoming requests correctly and render the expected responses.

**Test-Driven Development (TDD):**
I used to follow the "Red-Green-Refactor" cycle in TDD.
- Initially, I write a failing test that defines the desired behavior.
- Then, I implement the code to make the test pass (the "Green" phase).
- Finally, I refactor the code as needed while ensuring all tests continue to pass.

**Testing Jobs or Worker classes:**
- Testing jobs that use Sidekiq in RSpec involves verifying that the background jobs are enqueued, executed, and perform the expected tasks.
- Sidekiq provides tools and RSpec allows you to create tests for this purpose.

**Testing Third-Party APIs:**
For testing third-party APIs, I used to implement mock and stub for external services, simulating responses and testing how the application interacts with these APIs.
Here are some of the popular gems that I have used for mocking and stubbing:
- Webmock gem: https://github.com/bblimke/webmock
- Vcr gem: https://github.com/vcr/vcr
